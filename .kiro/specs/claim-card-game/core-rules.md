# ⚔️ CLAIM - Complete Rules ⚔️

> **Declare your suit. Build your hand. Or face the Reckoning of CLAIM.**

## **📦 Game Setup**

- **Players:** 4
- **Deck:** 1 Standard 52-Card Deck (No Jokers)
- **Tools:** Pen and paper for scoring

### **Initial Setup**

1. The dealer is not a player but a role that rotates among players to ensure fairness
2. For the first round, randomly select a player to act as the dealer
3. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals **3 cards** to each player
4. The remaining 40 cards form the draw pile

## **💰 Player Budget System**

Each player starts with a budget of **1352 points** calculated as:
(14+13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2) × 13 = 1352 points

This represents the maximum possible penalty a player could accumulate.

## **🔄 Game Flow**

### **Phase 1: Initial Declaration (Simultaneous)**

All players simultaneously decide whether to declare a suit:
- **Declare:** Choose a suit and optionally place one or more face-up cards of that suit from their hand
- **Don't Declare:** Take an immediate penalty based on the value of their highest card

Players who don't declare accumulate penalties each round until they declare.

**Timing:** A 30-second countdown is used for players to make their decisions. After the countdown, there is a "3, 2, 1" count with a 1-second pause after each number to allow players to simultaneously reveal their declaration or place cards. This brief pause ensures all players have time to act without reading instructions or making last-minute decisions.

### **Phase 2: Floor Card Rounds**

After the initial declaration, the game proceeds in rounds:

1. **Dealer Reveal:** The dealer places one card face-up as the **Floor Card**
2. **Player Actions:** Starting with a randomly selected first player each round, each player takes one action:
   - **Pick Up:** Take the Floor Card (may discard one card from hand)
   - **Pass:** Decline the Floor Card
   - **Declare:** Declare a suit (if not already declared)
   - **Showdown:** Call for a Showdown (if minimum requirements are met)
3. **Unused Floor Cards:** If no player picks up the Floor Card, it goes to the bottom of the draw pile

**Dealer Rotation:** After each round, a new random player is selected to be the dealer. This ensures that no player repeatedly gains the advantage of being the first to act, and all players get an equal opportunity to experience different positions in the turn order over time.

## **🎯 Key Actions**

### **Action 1: Declaration**

Players can declare a suit at any time before they've already declared:
- **Partial Declaration:** Simply declare a suit without showing cards
- **Full Declaration:** Place one or more face-up cards of the same suit from hand

**Strategic Note:** Players might choose not to declare to avoid penalties or to bluff.

### **Action 2: Showdown**

Players can call for a Showdown when they meet the minimum requirement of 27 points:
- **Minimum Calculation:** (Card Values × Number of Cards) ≥ 27
- **Example:** A, K of the same suit = (14 + 13) × 2 = 54 points
- **Example:** 2, 3, 4 of the same suit = (2 + 3 + 4) × 3 = 27 points

**Blitz Showdown:** Can be called immediately after initial declaration phase.

**Showdown Requirements:**
- Player must have declared a suit
- Minimum 27 points (Hoarder's Multiplier system)
- Can include cards from the table that have been picked up by any player

## **📊 Scoring System**

### **For Players Who Declared a Suit**

1. **Calculate Positive Score (The Hoarder's Multiplier):**
   - Identify all sequences of consecutive cards in your declared suit (A-K wrap around to 2)
   - For each sequence: (Sum of card values in sequence) × (Number of cards in sequence)
   - **Total Positive Points = Sum of all sequence scores**
   - **Example:** A♠, K♠, 2♠, 3♠, 4♠, 5♠ = 
     - Sequence 1 (A-K): (14+13) × 2 = 54
     - Sequence 2 (2-3-4-5): (2+3+4+5) × 4 = 56
     - Total Positive Points: 54 + 56 = 110

2. **Calculate Penalty:**
   - Sum of values of all non-declared suit cards

3. **Final Score: Positive Points - Penalty**

### **For Players Who Did NOT Declare a Suit**

1. **Calculate Negative Score (Same Hoarder's Multiplier System):**
   - Identify all sequences of consecutive cards in ANY suit (A-K wrap around to 2)
   - For each sequence: (Sum of card values in sequence) × (Number of cards in sequence)
   - **Total Negative Points = -(Sum of all sequence scores)**
   - **If there are no sequences, sum the face values of all cards as negative points**
   - **Example with sequences:** A♠, K♠, 2♥, 3♥, 4♥, 5♥ = 
     - Sequence 1 (A-K): (14+13) × 2 = 54
     - Sequence 2 (2-3-4-5): (2+3+4+5) × 4 = 56
     - Total Negative Points: -(54 + 56) = -110
   - **Example with no sequences:** J♥, 9♦, 7♠, 4♣, 3♣ = -(11 + 9 + 7 + 4 + 3) = -34

## **💰 Payment System**

When a Showdown is called:
1. All players reveal their hands
2. Each player calculates their score
3. The Showdown caller pays winners the difference in scores
4. Players who never declared pay penalties to everyone else

**Important:** Penalties are included in Showdown calculations. If a player has accumulated penalties, they must ensure their positive score exceeds their penalties to call a valid Showdown.

## **🎲 Detailed Examples**

### **Example 1: Blitz Showdown Strategy**

**Setup:** 
- Player A is dealt A♦, K♦, 2♦, 3♦, 4♦
- Other players have mixed hands but haven't declared

**Action:**
- Player A declares Diamonds and immediately calls Showdown

**Scoring:**
- Player A: 
  - Sequence 1 (A-K): (14 + 13) × 2 = 54
  - Sequence 2 (2-3-4): (2 + 3 + 4) × 3 = 27
  - Total Positive Points: 54 + 27 = 81, Penalty: 0
- Final Score: 81 points
- Other players (undeclared): Penalties based on their cards
- Player A collects from all other players

### **Example 2: Multi-Round Play**

**Round 1:**
- Player B has K♠, Q♠, J♠ but doesn't declare (takes 13-point penalty)
- Floor Card: 10♠ - Player B picks it up, may discard a card

**Round 2:**
- Player B now has K♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠ (declares Spades)
- Floor Card: 9♥ - Player B passes

**Showdown:**
- Player B calls Showdown with K♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠
- Sequence 1 (10-J-Q-K): (10 + 11 + 12 + 13) × 4 = 184
- Total Positive Points: 184, Penalty: 0
- Final Score: 184 points

### **Example 3: Complex Payment Calculation**

**Showdown Called by Player A:**
- Player A (declared): A♦, K♦, Q♦ = Sequence 1 (Q-K-A): (12 + 13 + 14) × 3 = 117, Total Positive Points: 117, Penalty: 0
- Player B (declared): J♠, 10♠, 9♠ = Sequence 1 (9-10-J): (9 + 10 + 11) × 3 = 90, Total Positive Points: 90, Penalty: 0
- Player C (undeclared): A♥, K♥, 2♣, 3♣, 4♣ = 
  - Sequence 1 (A-K): (14 + 13) × 2 = 54
  - Sequence 2 (2-3-4): (2 + 3 + 4) × 3 = 27
  - Total Negative Points: -(54 + 27) = -81
- Player D (declared): 2♠, 3♠, 4♠, 5♠ = Sequence 1 (2-3-4-5): (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) × 4 = 56, Total Positive Points: 56, Penalty: 0

**Payments:**
- Player A (winner) receives from others:
  - From Player B: 117 - 90 = 27 points
  - From Player C: 117 - (-81) = 198 points
  - From Player D: 117 - 56 = 61 points
- Player B pays Player A: 27 points
- Player C pays all players: 81 points total
- Player D pays Player A: 61 points

### **Example 4: Penalty Accumulation**

**Initial Declaration Phase:**
- Player C holds A♥, K♥ but doesn't declare (14-point penalty)

**Round 1:**
- Floor Card: 2♠ - Player C passes (accumulates another 14-point penalty)
- Total penalties for Player C: 28 points

**Round 2:**
- Floor Card: 3♦ - Player C passes (accumulates another 14-point penalty)
- Total penalties for Player C: 42 points

Player C must now have a positive score that exceeds 42 points to call a valid Showdown.
