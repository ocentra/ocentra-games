### **🔥 Part 1: The Pitch - The Soul of the Game**

Imagine a game so simple, you can learn it in three minutes. But a game so brutal, it can end in thirty seconds. A game where a single card can be a triumph or a trap, and hesitation is the deadliest sin of all.

This is **CLAIM**.

It's a high-stakes duel of wits and nerve played with a standard deck of cards. You are dealt a mere three cards, and in that hand could be the key to a triumphant victory or a crippling, debt-ridden loss. The goal is to accumulate points by hoarding cards of a single suit. But to score, you must publicly **Declare** that suit, painting a target on your back for every other player to see.

The heart of the game is the ever-present threat of a **Showdown**. At any moment, any player can slam their cards down and force the game to an end. Those who were slow to commit, who were still building their hand or waiting for the perfect moment, are punished with severe, multiplied negative points.

A player lucky enough to start with a simple 2-3-4 run can end the game in a single, brutal "ambush" move. A player with only high cards like Ace and King can go all-in on a **"High Card Gambit"** and still win. This is a game where aggression is rewarded, patience is a monumental risk, and the clock is always ticking.

**CLAIM** is _simple as hell, brutal as the devil._

### **🧠⚔️ Part 4: The Strategic Landscape - A Guide to Psychological Warfare**

**CLAIM** is more than a game of cards; it's a game of people. Master these concepts to master the game.

- **The High Card Gambit:** An all-in strategy of using high-value cards (A, K, Q) to win a Blitz Showdown, even without a run. It's a statement of pure aggression that can win the game before it begins.
- **The Ambush & The Rebuttal:** The core offensive/defensive dynamic. An aggressive player calls a Showdown with a weak hand, hoping no one can Rebut. A defensive player holds a 3-card run, knowing they can survive an ambush and turn the tables.
- **The Open Floor & The Art of the Block:** The rule that anyone can pick up a card, even to block another player, makes Declaring a suit a terrifying act of vulnerability. Watching an opponent pick up the Ace you need is a special kind of pain.
- **The Ticking Clock:** Your hand size is your potential penalty. The longer the game goes on, the more devastating a sudden Showdown becomes for the uncommitted. This forces action and prevents stagnation.
- **Patience vs. Aggression:** The central tension of CLAIM. Do you call a Showdown with a decent hand now, or wait for a perfect one and risk someone else ending the game first?

#### **Advanced Tactics & Player Dynamics**

- **The "Kingmaker" Scenario:** Imagine a 4-player game where Player A has an unbeatable hand. Player D, with no chance of winning, can now decide who loses the _most_. By strategically picking up or declining cards, Player D can sabotage one opponent to help another, effectively choosing second place. This isn't a flaw; it's a feature of high-stakes multiplayer games and a core part of the psychological warfare.
- **The "Information Cascade":** Player A Declares Spades. The A♠ appears. Player C, who doesn't need Spades, picks it up just to block Player A. The consequence? Player C now has a powerful penalty card (14 points) in hand, significantly increasing their own risk. This creates a brilliant dilemma: "Do I hurt my opponent now at the cost of hurting myself more later?" The act of blocking is itself a risk, preventing players from doing it casually.
- **The "Passive Aggressor":** A degenerate strategy where a player's goal is not to win, but to ensure another specific player loses. This player never Declares a suit. They simply pick up every card of their target's suit. The Passive Aggressor will end with a massive negative score but may succeed in torpedoing their rival's game, allowing a third player to win.
